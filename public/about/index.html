RRRRThats5Rs.com was created in early 2006 with the goal of satirizing and mocking online gaming, but has grown into a social experiment. The site's games are designed to be simple, frustrating and pointless to see how players will react to slight changes of expected gaming behavior.
<p/>
<p>
Although online games seem like a chaotic and fluid genre, the types of gameplay intensely clusters around the latest trends. One game becomes tremendously popular and a long slew of copycat games follow... whether defending a castle, escaping a room, or anything involving stick figures and death. These waves of games condition the average player to behave in a precise manner and expect a nearly identical gameplay.
<p/>
<p>
At RRRR, we see this as the perfect opportunity for experimentation, so we create behavioral traps in our games by installing <a class="outlink" title="Non Sequitur Definition" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/non%20sequitur" target="_blank"><strong>non sequiturs</strong></a> - changing some aspect that is always constant in most typical games, and not warning the player.
<p/>
<p>
Below is a summary of design experiments we created on RRRR - the rationale behind each game, some playing statistics, and our favorite comments.
</p>
</div>





<div id="dont-shoot-the-puppy" style="width:500px; background-color:#531; padding: 10px; margin:20px auto; text-align:left;">

Viewed over 40,000,000 times, this game asked the question "how hard is it to do nothing?". When so many other Flash games needed lightning-quick reflexes and complex problem solving, Don't Shoot the Puppy looked like it needed those things too, but if you did anything you lost.
<br/><br/>Thousands of comments proved how hard it was for people to think of inaction as a strategy, and still more fell for the later levels (which somehow tricked people when all the ones before were solved without touching anything). From fake popup ads to fake blank screens to fake obstacles, players convinced themselves that <em>this time</em> the puppy needed help, but what we didn't realize was how many people <strong>could not just sit and watch for 10 minutes.</strong> Even though we sit through movies or TV for hours on end, Flash games are so ADD-friendly that many people <a class="outlink" title="A Music Video of the Game" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8DvBqu55a8" target="_blank">lost patience and knowingly killed the dog</a>.

The inspiration for this game came from watching people play <a class="outlink" href="http://www.addictinggames.com/kittencannon.html">Kitten Cannon</a>. Pick an angle, power and watch as your kitten bounces off, hitting randomly placed boosters. People got so excited watching it, even though the success of the game was completely random.
<br/><br/>
To toy with people, we made a similar game, except that it is impossible to lose. On the third kick, the random booster placer stops being random and perfectly places each booster based on the projectile's trajectory. It requires no skill, but neither does Kitten Cannon.
<br/><br/>
Oh, and the high score list is fake: it only exists on your computer.

<a href="/games/stacked-odds/"><div style="font-size:20px;margin:0">Stacked Odds</div><img style="float:right;" src="/media/icons/stacked.png"></a><br/>
When someone plays Tetris, they follow a simple rule: try to fill the deepest gap. When a gap forms, they will try to fill it with the best piece available, sometimes waiting for that perfect piece to show up.
<br/><br/>
What if that piece never shows up? This game has an AI that finds which piece that player most desperately needs, and doesn't give it to him. More specifically, it finds the deepest hole, and gives you only the pieces that don't fit into it.
<br/><br/>
We were recently informed that it is actually possible to get into an infinite loop and beat the game. If we ever make Stacked Odds 2.0 we'll fix that bug, but until then see if you can figure it out!

<h3>Statistics:</h3>
<img src="/media/graphs/graph.png"><br/>When you lose a game of Stacked Odds, it used to send your score to our server. After 2175 games, we created this histogram of scores. We were impressed to see that someone stuck with it long enough to clear 101 lines, but many people failed to even clear one.<br/>

<div id="cheer-up-the-chatbot" style="width:500px; background-color:#531; padding: 10px; margin:20px auto; text-align:left;">
<a href="/games/cheer-up-the-chatbot/"><div style="font-size:20px;margin:0">Cheer Up the ChatBot</div><img style="float:right;" src="/media/icons/cheerup.png"></a><br/>
<p>
Why talk to computers when you can talk to real people instead?
</p>
<p>
One of the many goals of artificial intelligence is to create a computer that can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" class="outlink">act human</a>. This turns out to be incredibly hard. If you are talking to someone online, it is very easy to tell that they are not really a human. Computers just aren't very good a pretending. Just try any other chatbot out there and you can experience the robotic responses.
</p>
<p>
But what if you were supposed to be talking to a computer: could you tell it was really a human?
</p>
<p>
This is the goal of Cheer Up the Chatbot. Players are faced with a cute image of a computer, and made to think that it is a chatbot. They ask it questions, and it responds with varying degrees of intelligence.
</p>
<p>
"It's pretty stupid at times, but sometimes it's bloody brilliant. The programming is pretty spiffy."
</p>
<p>
We aren't dedicated enough to create an intelligent chatbot. Fortunately it is easy to fake.  When a player loads the page, they are connected to our server. So if more than one person is playing at the same time, we can just have them talk to each other. If there is an odd person out, they are stuck talking to our terribly stupid chatbot.
</p>
<p>
And just to make things exciting, an algorithm switches people around sometimes, mid conversation. This creates an exciting sense of uncertainty. You never truly know if you are talking to a person, or if it is even the same person as before. It is such a simple system, and yet it is still fun to play even after you know the trick. People play the game just to talk to and trick the uninitiated.
</p>
<p>
A few people have asked us for a special chatting mode that distinguishes between players in the game, instead of always saying "chatbot." These people were so desperate for this playing mode that they paid us $5 for the secret ability.

What happens when quantitative questions start getting more and more vague? And what happens when you have a multiple choice question where nothing is correct? Pretty self-explanatory and well-received, except for a few who couldn't tolerate a game where losing points was required.

Perhaps the deepest realization comes while playing this game: "I'm playing myself!" As the player moves up the grid on each level, their chosen path is used to block him in later rounds. New users see the new moving pieces as pre-programmed enemies, figuring out patterns to avoid the complex AI. Only later do some figure out that they're actually avoiding their own past decisions, and can carefully plan their own movements to save themselves later on.

Ever yell at your computer before? Ever do it while laughing? This simple physics-based puzzle game has one twist: you use your microphone to play. We created this hoping that people would laugh at themselves, and it certainly works.

The loading bar is the game. When it's full, the game is finished. About 50/50 response between those who thought their time was wasted (since there was no game afterwards), and those who appreciated that the loading bar <em>was </em>the game.

Someone got over 1,000 on this. 1,000 minutes. Need we say more? Also, despite how completely pointless this game was, some users created automated scripts to play while they were running errands; others just had 1 minute alarms at their desks. No hidden tricks, just an example of the effort people spend playing the dumbest things.

Why would anyone want to play a simple tic-tac-toe game? Because they can't figure out why the game says they've lost. If only one person wins, then everyone hasn't won. The only way to beat Everyone's a Winner is to work with the computer and create a tie game.

Named after Helen Keller, this experiment explored Flash games from a blind person's perspective. An exercise in gameplay without clicking on buttons or GUIs, only interacting with the words that tell you what to do. With almost no visual feedback in the entire game users grew frustrated, and with time limits that no one could see (blind people can't cross the street too slowly) winning was never as simple as it seemed. Some users think their resolution is the problem, because a game can't be completely dark, right?

Guaranteed replay value. The critic asks you to draw things and decides if what you made was good enough, but unlike most games the probability of him approving is random. Instead of the yes-or-no deterministic games everywhere, can people realize when a game is ruled by chance? No one in the comments seemed to notice, only complaining that once it was beaten there was no replay value. So we made it impossible to win the first 12 times you play, and even though some have won after 12 times they still haven't mentioned that it could be chance.

Instead of simply changing the graphics (like nearly every other memory matching game on the web), a simple twist makes this game much more challenging and fun. Actually, making it fun was an accident.

This game has pretty vague directions, and that's pretty much it.

This was an idea I had for how to make a better drawing application. I was frustrated with how hard it is to change colors in normal drawing applications. In Smudge, you just grab the color you want and drag it. It's also the only original game not written in Flash, so it still works!<br><br>

The game with the clearest message, Get A Life has nothing for you to do but quit. The faster you realize that, the higher your score.  But it is hard to figure it out when there is a big red count-down timer in your face, a "1-up" sign, and other distractions. If you want a good laugh, watch someone frantically click while they try to play it.
